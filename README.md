# NixOps Hetzner Cloud Plugin

[NixOps](https://github.com/NixOS/nixops) plugin for Hetzner Cloud integraiton.

## Quickstart

See the main NixOps repo instructions for how to build NixOps with plugins. The easiest way to get
authentication working is to get the [hcloud cli](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli) and
configure a context, but there are other ways to set credentials (see deployment.hcloud.token and
deployment.hcloud.context options).

See `tests/functional/single_machine_hcloud_base.nix` for usage examples.

## Bootstrapping

The hcloud backend requires that you have a preconfigured NixOps snapshot. Hetzner provides a NixOs
ISO but there's no way to install from it automatically, so you should boot from this ISO and
follow the steps detailed in `bootstrap/nixos-install-hetzner-cloud.sh`. Then create a snapshot
from the bootstraped server with a label named `nixops`, no value needed.

## Status

Implemented:
* Server lifecycle management. Most optional machine actions are not implemented, such as reboot
and rescue.
* Volume creation, attachment and mounting.
* SSH keys.

PRs implementing missing resources and functionality are welcome.

## Known Issues

* hcloud backend requires a preconfigured NixOs snapshot.

## Development

```shellsession
$ nix-shell
$ poetry shell
```

The project uses pylint, mypy, isort and black as linters, these are all included as dev
dependencies in pyproject.toml. There are no automated lints and the codebase is riddled with
warnings, I'm working on getting the code up to standards.
